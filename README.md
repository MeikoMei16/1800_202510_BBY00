## Limitations and Future Work
### Limitations

Example:
- Currently, the app only supports city-based weather searches.
- Limited to basic weather parameters like temperature, humidity, and conditions.
- The user interface can be further enhanced for accessibility.

### Future Work

Example: 
- Add support for location-based weather detection using GPS.
- Implement additional weather parameters like wind speed and UV index.
- Create a dark mode for better usability in low-light conditions.
- Integrate user accounts for saving favorite locations.
